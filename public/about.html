<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>My name is Iniabasi Ntekim. I prefer people calling me 
  Ini mostly because they can't pronounce my full name and you have to admit
  Ini sounds kinda cool. I come from a family of six. I have 3 wonderful kind of annoying siblings.
  I have no favourite anything. No favourite food, no favourite colour, no favourite
  anything you can think of. I'm fructose intolerance. This means i can't take food that is high 
  in fructose like honey.

<p> I was studying Medicine in Ukraine until the was started. Now, i'm looking to get admission into veritas 
  University to study nursing. I decided to evolve with the world in the aspect of technology. That's why I'm here 
  studying web development. I'm going to be a freelancer. If i could turn back the hands of time, I would prolly 
  study Accounting. I can't really explain why. I just have a thing for it.

I bake(somtimes), make hair (not professionally tho) and I like watching good movies. I mean, who doesn't. I also enjoy reading 
good novels just that i don't go all out to get one but if it comes to me why not. If i was asked to use three words to describe myself, 
i would describe myself as reserved, smart and accomodating.
